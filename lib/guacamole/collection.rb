  # You use this as a mixin in your collection classes. Per convention,
  # they are the plural form of your model with the suffix `Collection`.
  # For example the collection of `Blogpost` models would be `BlogpostsCollection`.
  # Including `Guacamole::Collection` will add a number of class methods to
  # the collection. See the `ClassMethods` submodule for details

    #   You can use this method for your hand made storage or update methods.
    #   Most of the time it makes more sense to call save or update though,
